# Minu's Case Study Responses


## What problems are facing the organization?
### The most pressing issues facing the education industry are the billions of dollars that are wasted annually in the U.S. education system on software that fails to meet the unique needs, skills, and contexts of individual schools within districts. 

## What is the target variable and what type (reg or class) of solution are they developing?
### The target variable would be the specific / suitable Mathematics software for a school district. The solution type that seems the most appropriate is classification because we are given that the software is categorized as either "suitable" or "not suitable."

## How would they know the solution was working (business metric)?
### They would know by looking at whether or not there is an increased adoption of their software (units sold, revenue) and also other metrics like improved student performance or higher teacher satisfaction. Furthermore, they could give out another survey after the model's deployment using the Likert scale from 1 to 5.

## What other issues might the team be facing?
### Other possible issues could be the diversity among the different districts which could be urban, suburban, or rural. This is particularly challenging as it would be difficult to ensure that the team's recommendations align with all districts. For instance, each district could have a different budget, educational priorities, or even cultural factors. 

## How difficult is the data to gather?
### We are given in the passage that the organization is non-profit, yet had to gather data from various school districts across different regions. In fact, they ensured diversity by limiting the responses at 100 per district. Furthermore, these are surveys, meaning the data is likely to be low-quality. The combination of both these reasons, for a non-profit organization, makes data collection difficult.

## Is the target difficult to measure or break into smaller parts?
### The target is difficult to measure because determining the suitable software means considering multiple variables like student performance and teacher satisfaction. In addition, breaking the target into smaller parts most likely requires feature engineering and validation of each variable's impact on the target. 

## What level of uncertainty (risk) are you willing to accept?
### While the ideal scenario is to have zero uncertainty / risk, this case study must have some degree of uncertainty as it relies on survey from students about a wide range of districts. I would be working to mitigate / reduce this uncertainty as much as possible; however, knowing the inconsistent nature of survey data, I would always expect some sort of uncertainty. The important point here to note is that we must be transparent about the model when implementing it, meaning the organization must clearly articulate the limitations of the model.
